End of Year Project 2022
Aditi, Aparna, and Geena

Project idea: BCA Note Sharing Website
    Students will be able to upload PDFs of their notes to a website that anyone can access, with different classes and units being available.

Goals
    Level 1: Build a functional and formatted website that anyone can access.
    Level 2: Users should be able to upload websites to the website and have them categorized
        based on their class year and the unit (through a form).
    Level 3: Create a way for notes to be checked and verified by an administrator on the
        website. This would prevent any malicious uploads. Verified notes would be 
        prioritized on the list of notes.
